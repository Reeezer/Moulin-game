It's allowed to have any number of cards in your hand at any time.&#x0d;
There are 8 types of regular Train Car cards, plus Locomotive cars and their colors match various routes between cities on the board.&#x0d;
Locomotives are multi-colored and act as a wild card that can be part of any set of cards.&#x0d;
If a replacement card is a locomotive, the player can't take it immediately. If at any time, 3 of the 5 face-up cards are Locomotives, all 5 cards are immediately discarded and 5 new ones are turned face-up to replace them.&#x0d;
When the deck is exhausted, the discards are reshuffled good and become a new draw pile deck.&#x0d;
When the deck gets empty and no discards are available, the player can't draw another Train car card anymore. Instead he may only claim a route or draw Destination Ticket cards."/>

A player can claim any open route on the board and they don't need to connect to any of his previously played routes.&#x0d;

Each Destination Ticket includes the name of two cities on the map and a point value and when the player can complete a connection between these two cities, he will score those points at the end of the game.&#x0d;
